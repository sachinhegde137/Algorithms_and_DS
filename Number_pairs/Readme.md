## Challenge
Given an array of integers and a target value, 
determine the number of pairs of array elements 
that have a difference equal to the target value.\
For example:

$k=1$

$arr=[1,2,3,4]$

Here, there are three values that differ by *k=1*:
(1,2), (2,3), (3,4).So the output must be 3.

## Input format
The first line is an integer which represents 
the value *k*. The second line n space separated integers
that form the array *arr*.

## Sample Input
```
2
1 5 3 4 2
```

## Sample Output
```
3
```
There are 3 pairs of integers in the set with 
a difference of 2: [5,3], [4,2] and [3,1].
